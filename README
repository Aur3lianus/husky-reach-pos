HUSKY POSITION REACHER

Description:
This package is used to make reach a set position in 3D space.

Requirements:
ROS2 Humble installation

A working robot.yaml file (warning - the official clearpath documentation provides a .yaml file, which does not work - one has to be found in the clearpath repository, or somewhere else on the internet)
The robot should be called a200_0000 in the .yaml file. If it isn't, or you are using a different version of Gazebo, you might have to remap the topic (see the Remapping section below)

Installation:
1. Clone the package source code into the src folder of your workspace.
2. Build the workspace, using:
colcon build
You can also build this package alone:
colcon build --packages-select husky-reach-pos
